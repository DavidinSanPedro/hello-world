my n00b attempt to get connected for public action

I am a divorced father of one son and have primary custody. my son is my owrld. I do Boy Scouts with him. He is nearing his Eagle rank and his final year of high school.
I love all animals but am especially partial to dogs.
I love al kinds of music and food and culture and arts. I am a true lover of humanity and all it's wonderful manifestations and nuanced differences.
I hope to help change the workd for the better through concerted public action to create synergistic and collaborative solutions that are elegant, radical, and really make for win-win-win paradigm shifts.
